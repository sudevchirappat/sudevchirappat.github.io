Today I woke up and decided that enough is enough. I have had too many of those days swelled up in frustration and desperation. I need to transform in to a nonchalant and better being and find my purpose in the world.

<br /> It's not easy. I know. It won't be a short journey. I know. 
<br /> But I need to figure out the ways of life. Run experiments, solve life's mysteries and strive for the best.

<h2> Target 1 : A better-looking me </h2>

Upon constant self reflections and though processes, I realise that my major drawback is lack of self-love. People say *"Oh, dear, how you look is not important. What's underneath is what matters!"*. Maybe they are right. But in this superficial rat-race world, I realise that I need to strive to look best for my survival.

A more healthier and acceptable physique is what I am going to achieve. I know that it's going to be tough. Lot of the daily posts that I plan to post here are going to be about me achieving that target.

Deadline : April 30 - 2015.
Reminders have been set
Timers are about to begin from this date.

All the best to myself.
