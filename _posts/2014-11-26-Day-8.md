title: Day 8
---

Wasted whole day again. It was a holiday and I woke up very late. I was supposed to have breakfast and study for the exam tomorrow. But, that didn't happen. The headache was killing my. I don't know how that caught up to me. It must be the ketones from burning up all that fat (smirk-face).
<br />
Didn't do any sort of excercise today and slept off after lunch again. I don't know why I am sleeping so much. I need to cut back on it. <br />
Will wake up early tomorrow and hit the road and cut back on some serious calories.
<br/>
With hope,<br />
Dave.
