Today was a disaster again! The exam went really bad. I will probably fail it. After the exam, came back and had some stupid food and slept off.
<br /> Woke up only the evening and went to the mall to buy some stuff. Bought it came back and had something to eat at the cafe late at night too. All these things are not helping my target at all.

<br />
I need to kick up my game here.!

Sadly, <br/>
Dave.
