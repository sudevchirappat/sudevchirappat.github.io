title: Day 4
---

I had a bad feeling before I went to sleep last night that today was going to be a bad day. I took it a bit extreme yesterday and that means waking up very late and having painful muscles and will be tired the whole day. But, it didn't quite happen that day. I woke up fairly early enough and didn't feel much of a pain-over from yesterday.

<br />
I slipped up a bit in between by falling for a cheap offer from Papa John's pizza. Had one too many slices of pizza adding up the calories. Also, the taste was horribly bad. Not going to spend anymore money on that franchise now.

<br />
In the evening, I didn't go out for buring up the calories, but I could feel a certain urge to go active and do something. Ended up stand-running for about 35 minutes and then do a lot of stretching excercises and push ups. Sweated a lot. That should be good for my skin atleast.
<br />

Feeling fresh now, after a bath. I need to study well for tomorrow's exam. I must do well. My mind is a lot less filled with clutter after good excercise. People were after all, right about the benefits of excercise.

<br />
The calorie count on Noom Coach shows 1810 / 1990 as of now. I will probably touch that after a night snack. 
<br />
Signing off, after a good day.
Dave.
