title: Day 6
---

I failed today. Didn't do any sort of work out and slept off in the evening. Due to this stupid examination that I have tomorrow, I will have to stay up very late too. To top it all, ate dinner uncontrollably. I should have stopped myself. Pumped in a lot of calories and that is making me feel drowsy. 

<br /> I need to kick up the game tomorrow. Will have to diet properly as well as excercise will for today also. I will do it.

<br />
With confidence...
<br />
Dave.
