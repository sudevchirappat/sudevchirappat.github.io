<p>I started this day in a very bad way. Woke up later than I wanted to although I had a presentation to get to at 10 o’clock. After hastily winding up the codes and plotting some stupid graph, reached my professor’s office 15 minutes late. After a quick scolding, disappointed sighs from the professor, got out of the place. </p>

<p>
I was supposed to work out in the morning to add up to this challenge. Well, that didn't happen. Worse still, I ate some *vadai* in the morning which did not suit well to my stomach. I slept of at an odd hour without having any food at all. By evening, had a terrible headache and couldn't even think properly.
</p>
<p>
Vomited profusely after a disturbing sleep. It was then that I decided to get out of my room. Walking slowly through the peaceful and beautiful campus, I could feel a lot of my stress and hence the headache slowly diffuse away. Passed by the Siva temple on the way. I think I should go there when it's aloof. The place feels so calming in it's natural silence.
</p>

<p>
After the walk, ate an *Aloo Paratha*. Not the best food for someone who should be on diet. But, I had to eat something. Came back and slept early. Headache was back by then. Gulped about three fifth of a *Crocin* pill and slept off. I could feel the pill working. Body heated up and down overnight and can't help but say I slept deep. Although, I plan not to take any more medicine for these silly stuff.
