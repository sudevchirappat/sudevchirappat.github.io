  <h2>Day 1</h2>

  <p>Today I woke up and decided that enough is enough. I have had too many of those days swelled up in frustration and desperation. I need to transform in to a nonchalant and better being and find my purpose in the world.</p>

<p><br /> It&#39;s not easy. I know. It won&#39;t be a short journey. I know. 
<br /> But I need to figure out the ways of life. Run experiments, solve life&#39;s mysteries and strive for the best.</p>

<h2> Target 1 : A better-looking me </h2>

<p>Upon constant self reflections and though processes, I realise that my major drawback is lack of self-love. People say <em>&quot;Oh, dear, how you look is not important. What&#39;s underneath is what matters!&quot;</em>. Maybe they are right. But in this superficial rat-race world, I realise that I need to strive to look best for my survival.</p>

<p>A more healthier and acceptable physique is what I am going to achieve. I know that it&#39;s going to be tough. Lot of the daily posts that I plan to post here are going to be about me achieving that target.</p>

<p>Deadline : April 30 - 2015.
Reminders have been set
Timers are about to begin from this date.</p>

<p>All the best to myself.</p>
