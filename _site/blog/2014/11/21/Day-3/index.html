  <h2>Day 3</h2>

  <p>I got to say, today was one awesome day. I woke up early and was fully energised to make it a very productive one. Went for a jog. And to my surprise, I treaded more mileage than I expected. After a few rounds in the institute stadium, I walked/jogged till the main gate, which is atleast two kilometers away and came back. Got really tired there for a minute, but I could feel the energy come back after a good bath and breakfast. </p>

<p><br />
To my surprise again, I studied a bit. A bit is a lot these days. If I do a sensus, the amount of time I have spent on coursework is negligibly low this semester. Gathered up the courage to go meet my project guide today. He was out of station. I need to get past this elephant in the room with him. Need to confess that I didn&#39;t do enough work and get an extension. After visiting him, mounted on my borrowed cycle to get back to hostel.
<br /></p>

<p>Aha, that&#39;s when I thought, why not bike a bit and add a few burn in my Noom Coach (By the way, that app is really good to keep track of your weight loss). Cycled quite fast till main gate again and back. I should explore more!
<br />
Academically, nothing much happened after that. Watched this serial &quot;Madam Secretary&quot; and wasted a lot of time. But, amazingly, didn&#39;t feel so bad about it today. This better lifestyle, even for a day, seems to be good for my morale. 
<br />
Played a bit of football after a long time (more like, never). I could feel my heart plunging in and out very hard. I should do this more often.
<br /></p>

<p>Oh..almost forgot. Noom Coach says my calorie intake for today is 2969. That&#39;s really on the high end. I shouldn&#39;t have taken that glucose gulps after the football game. Burned 1200 today. That&#39;s could be a record for me. Need to do more and more. Feeling excited!
<br /></p>

<p>Signing off on a good day!</p>
